# nix

I use `configuration.nix`, `home.nix`, and `flake.nix` to ensure my setup is consistent. These files handle everything from system settings to user-specific tweaks, making it easy to install the software I need and keep everything organized. The goal is to have a reproducible setup, so I can always get the same environment with minimal effort.
